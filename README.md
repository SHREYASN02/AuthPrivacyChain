# AuthPrivacyChain: Blockchain-Based Access Control Framework

📌 Project Overview

AuthPrivacyChain is a blockchain-based access control framework designed to enhance security and privacy in cloud environments. It leverages smart contracts and cryptographic techniques to provide decentralized, tamper-proof, and privacy-preserving access control for cloud-stored data.

📖 Introduction

With the growing adoption of cloud computing, securing sensitive data has become crucial. Traditional access control mechanisms are centralized, making them vulnerable to breaches and insider attacks. AuthPrivacyChain solves this by introducing a decentralized access control framework that ensures secure and privacy-aware data access using blockchain technology.

✨ Key Features

✔ Decentralized & Tamper-Proof – Uses blockchain to store access control policies securely.
✔ Privacy Protection – Encrypts access rights and uses zero-knowledge proofs to enhance security.
✔ Smart Contract-Based Access Control – Automates authentication and authorization processes.
✔ Interoperability – Compatible with multiple cloud platforms and IoT devices.
✔ Automatic Revocation – Supports time-based and event-based access revocation.

🛠 Technologies Used

Blockchain Frameworks: Ethereum, Hyperledger, EOS
Smart Contracts: Solidity
Web Technologies: Flask, Web3.py
Cryptography: AES Encryption, Zero-Knowledge Proofs
